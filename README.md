# Metasploit Lab – Metasploitable Environment

## Overview
This project is a cyber security practical lab using **Kali Linux** and
**Metasploitable** in a VirtualBox environment.

The lab demonstrates how vulnerabilities can be identified and exploited
using the **Metasploit Framework** for learning purposes.
